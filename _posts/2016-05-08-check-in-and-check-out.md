Check In and Check Out

You are more than welcome to check-in anytime after 3 pm. Below you will find instructions on how to get in the door. There is a chance my mom won't be there when you check in, because she is running some errands. In that case, make yourself at home and if you have any questions at all, shoot me a message.

Parking is on the street. 

Check out is before 11 am on check out day.

Early Check-In

If you need to check in early, feel free to put your stuff in the living room, but please don't enter the room before 3 pm because either the previous guest is still there or the room hasn't been clean yet. If you access the room early, there will be a fee of $30 taken out of your security deposit.
